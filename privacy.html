  <h1>Privacy Policy for Read Companion</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Read Companion is a Chrome browser extension designed to enhance the user's online reading experience through AI-powered text analysis. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines what data is collected, how it is used, and the measures taken to safeguard your information.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Read Companion collects only the text that users explicitly select (highlight) for analysis. We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII), monitor browsing activity, or access any content beyond the highlighted selection.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Collected Information</h2>
  <p>The selected text is temporarily transmitted to a third-party natural language processing service (e.g., OpenAI API) solely to generate a contextual explanation. This information is not stored or logged by the extension.</p>

  <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>The extension may store user-defined preferencesâ€”such as custom prompts or UI settingsâ€”locally using Chromeâ€™s <code>storage</code> API. This data remains on the userâ€™s device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Handling of API Keys</h2>
  <p>If an API key is required, it is stored locally on the user's device and is never transmitted to our servers. Users retain full control over the API key and may delete it at any time.</p>

  <h2>5. Extension Permissions</h2>
  <p>The permissions requested by Read Companion (e.g., <code>activeTab</code>, <code>contextMenus</code>, <code>scripting</code>) are essential for its core functionalityâ€”namely, to analyze selected text and provide context-aware results. These permissions are used in a limited and transparent manner.</p>

  <h2>6. No Third-Party Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not utilize analytics services, tracking cookies, or behavioral profiling tools. No data is collected for marketing, advertising, or statistical purposes.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Transmission and Security</h2>
  <p>All communication with third-party services is encrypted using HTTPS to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data. While we take reasonable measures to secure data during transmission, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of third-party endpoints.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
