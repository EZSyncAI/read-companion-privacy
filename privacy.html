Privacy Policy for Read Companion

Effective Date: 04/01/2025

Overview
Read Companion is a Chrome extension that enhances your online reading experience by providing AI-powered text analysis. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

1. Data Collection
Read Companion only collects data you explicitly select (highlighted text) in order to provide AI-generated explanations. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or track your browsing activity.

2. Data Usage
The selected text is sent to a third-party AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate a response. The data is used only to fulfill your request for analysis and is not stored or reused by Read Companion.

3. Local Storage
We use Chromeâ€™s storage API to save your preferences (e.g., custom prompts) locally on your device. No data is transmitted to our servers or third parties beyond the selected text for analysis.

4. API Keys and Privacy
Your API key (if entered) is stored only on your local device and is never transmitted or shared by the extension.

5. Permissions
Read Companion requires permissions to access the active tab and content of the page to enable text selection and context-aware analysis. These permissions are used strictly for the extensionâ€™s core functionality.

6. No Analytics or Tracking
We do not use any analytics tools, tracking scripts, or cookies.

7. Data Security
All data transmission to third-party APIs is done over HTTPS. We take reasonable precautions to ensure your data is handled securely.
